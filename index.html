                <p>Every day, 690 million people go hungry, almost one in ten people worldwide. More than 10,000 children die from hunger related causes each day. As the population grows rapidly in many developing countries, these numbers are only on the rise.
                </p>
		<p>Though these issues are serious and upsetting, we know that change is possible. The future of hungry people is not hopeless. That is why we are asking for your help to make the world a better place.
